## Daniel here

Obviously, I am a developer. I have over 8 years of professional experience in different roles: freelance, co-founder, technical lead, account manager and much more. I am experienced with all stages of development for web applications.

My Github is connected to several organizations because I like to give my client's full access to their code and any software used. (Just for their own sanity and in case I choke with a boneless wing)

A couple of experiments that include:

- ~~A petite admin: something that uses Netlify Identities and pulls data from Google Drive~~ Edit: I am no longer in love with Netlify after Vercel came into my life
- **Soon**. Vercel integrations library. I love the analytics and some other integrations that connect with Vercel like Axiom. I will develop a library of code snippets to make these integrations
