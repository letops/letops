## Daniel here

Obviously, I am a developer. I have over 8 years of experience working as a freelance, co-founder, technical lead, account manager and much more. I am experienced with all stages of development for web applications.

My Github is connected to several organizations because I like to give my client's full access to their code and any software used. (Just for their own sanity and in case I choke with a boneless wing)

### ðŸ”­ Currently working on...

Django + Wagtail + React + Netlify Functions in:
- [MedGlobal](https://www.medglobalgroup.com/?referrer=letops)
- [MedGlobal's INSIGHTS](https://insights.medglobalgroup.com/?referrer=letops)
- [INESA](https://app.inesa.com.mx/?referrer=letops)
- [Nunuu](https://www.nunuu.mx/?referrer=letops)

A couple of experiments that include:
- NextJS: a boilerplate that wraps MUI, Apollo, i18n and much more
- A petite admin: something that uses Netlify Identities and pulls data from Google Drive

### âš¡ Fun fact: ...

I am a knowledge-sponge about several subjects, including quantum mechanics, astrophysics, biology, medicine, movies and tv-series. For some strange reason my brain gives it a big priority to this information, so events and people's names get purged from my memory every once in a while. Yeah, it is weird.
